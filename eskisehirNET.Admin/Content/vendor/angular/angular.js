     * A root scope can be retrieved using the {@link ng.$rootScope $rootScope} key from the

       * @description
       * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
       *
       * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
       *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (Since
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} reruns when it detects changes the
       *   `watchExpression` can execute multiple times per
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} and should be idempotent.)
       * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
       *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
       *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
       *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
       *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
       *   (see next point)
       * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
       *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
       *   later comparison, the {@link angular.copy} function is used. This therefore means that
       *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
       * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
       *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
       *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
       *
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Be prepared for
       * multiple calls to your `watchExpression` because it will execute multiple times in a
       * single {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle if a change is detected.)
       *
       * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
       * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
       * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
       * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
       * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
       * listener was called due to initialization.
       *
       *
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           // let's assume that scope was dependency injected as the $rootScope

       * @ngdoc method
       * @name $rootScope.Scope#$digest
       * @kind function
       *
       * @description
       * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
       * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
       * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
       * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
       * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
       * iterations exceeds 10.
       *
       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
       *
       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           var scope = ...;
           scope.name = 'misko';
           scope.counter = 0;

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered

       * @description
       * `$apply()` is used to execute an expression in angular from outside of the angular
       * framework. (For example from browser DOM events, setTimeout, XHR or third party libraries).
       * Because we are calling into the angular framework we need to perform proper scope life
       * cycle of {@link ng.$exceptionHandler exception handling},
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest executing watches}.
       *
       * ## Life cycle
       *
       * # Pseudo-Code of `$apply()`
       * ```js
           function $apply(expr) {
             try {
               return $eval(expr);
             } catch (e) {

               $root.$digest();
             }
           }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Scope's `$apply()` method transitions through the following stages:
       *
       * 1. The {@link guide/expression expression} is executed using the
       *    {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$eval $eval()} method.
       * 2. Any exceptions from the execution of the expression are forwarded to the
       *    {@link ng.$exceptionHandler $exceptionHandler} service.
       * 3. The {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watch} listeners are fired immediately after the
       *    expression was executed using the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} method.
       *
       *
       * @param {(string|function())=} exp An angular expression to be executed.
       *
       *    - `string`: execute using the rules as defined in {@link guide/expression expression}.
       *    - `function(scope)`: execute the function with current `scope` parameter.
       *
       * @returns {*} The result of evaluating the expression.

 *
 * `$sceDelegate` is a service that is used by the `$sce` service to provide {@link ng.$sce Strict
 * Contextual Escaping (SCE)} services to AngularJS.
 *
 * Typically, you would configure or override the {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} instead of
 * the `$sce` service to customize the way Strict Contextual Escaping works in AngularJS.  This is
 * because, while the `$sce` provides numerous shorthand methods, etc., you really only need to
 * override 3 core functions (`trustAs`, `getTrusted` and `valueOf`) to replace the way things
 * work because `$sce` delegates to `$sceDelegate` for these operations.
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} to configure this service.
 *
 * The default instance of `$sceDelegate` should work out of the box with little pain.  While you
 * can override it completely to change the behavior of `$sce`, the common case would
 * involve configuring the {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} instead by setting
 * your own whitelists and blacklists for trusting URLs used for loading AngularJS resources such as
 * templates.  Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist
 * $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlBlacklist}

 *
 * The `$sceDelegateProvider` provider allows developers to configure the {@link ng.$sceDelegate
 * $sceDelegate} service.  This allows one to get/set the whitelists and blacklists used to ensure
 * that the URLs used for sourcing Angular templates are safe.  Refer {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and
 * {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlBlacklist}
 *
 * For the general details about this service in Angular, read the main page for {@link ng.$sce
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)}.
 *
 * **Example**:  Consider the following case. <a name="example"></a>
 *
 * - your app is hosted at url `http://myapp.example.com/`
 * - but some of your templates are hosted on other domains you control such as
 *   `http://srv01.assets.example.com/`,  `http://srv02.assets.example.com/`, etc.
 * - and you have an open redirect at `http://myapp.example.com/clickThru?...`.
 *
 * Here is what a secure configuration for this scenario might look like:
 *
 * ```
 *  angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $sce
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *
 * `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
 *
 * # Strict Contextual Escaping
 *
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain
 * contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.  One example of
 * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer
 * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.
 *
 * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.
 *
 * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE<11 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE<11 allow
 * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer
 * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.
 * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`
 * to the top of your HTML document.
 *
 * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for
 * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
 *
 * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
 *
 * ```
 * <input ng-model="userHtml" aria-label="User input">
 * <div ng-bind-html="userHtml"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE
 * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.
 * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via
 * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates
 * security vulnerabilities.)
 *
 * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
 * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
 *
 * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
 * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
 * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
 * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
 *
 * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
 * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
 * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
 * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
 * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
 * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
 * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.
 *
 * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
 * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
 * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.
 *
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
 * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the
 * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.
 *
 * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly
 * simplified):
 *
 * ```
 * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attr) {
 *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
 *       element.html(value || '');
 *     });
 *   };
 * }];
 * ```
 *
 * ## Impact on loading templates
 *
 * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
 * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
 *
 * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
 * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or
 * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist
 * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.
 *
 * *Please note*:
 * The browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
 * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
 * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## This feels like too much overhead
 *
 * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
 *
 * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
 * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.
 * `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works.
 *
 * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them
 * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.
 *
 * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
 * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
 * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
 * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.
 *
 * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
 * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
 * security onto an application later.
 *
 * <a name="contexts"></a>
 * ## What trusted context types are supported?
 *
 * | Context             | Notes          |
 * |---------------------|----------------|
 * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
 * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |
 * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |
 * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 *
 * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
 *
 *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
 *
 *  - **'self'**
 *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same
 *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
 *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
 *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource
 *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
 *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters
 *      match themselves.
 *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
 *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and '`;`'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
 *      in a whitelist.
 *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not
 *      appropriate for use in a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
 *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
 *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
 *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
 *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)
 *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax
 *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
 *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
 *      have good test coverage).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
 *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
 *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
 *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
 *      as a last resort.
 *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is
 *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
 *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
 *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
 *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
 *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
 *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
 *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
 *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
 *      enough before coding your own.  E.g. Ruby has
 *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
 *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
 *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
 *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
 *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.

 * ## Can I disable SCE completely?
 *
 * Yes, you can.  However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits
 * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and
 * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE
 * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
 * you're migrating them a module at a time.
 *
 * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
 *
 * ```
 * angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
 *   // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!
 *   // Do not use in new projects.
 *   $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 * });
 * ```

  /* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.
   *
   * The API contract for the SCE delegate
   * -------------------------------------
   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:
   *
   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)
   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the
   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by
   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.
   *
   * - valueOf(value)
   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were
   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if
   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given
   *     such a value.
   *
   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)
   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by
   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.
   *
   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be
   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For
   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In
   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would
   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or
   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based
   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special
   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.
   *
   *
   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts
   * ------------------------------------------------
   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This
   * is purely an implementation details.
   *
   * The contract is simply this:
   *
   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)
   *     will also succeed.
   *
   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way.  In some future, we
   * may not use inheritance anymore.  That is OK because no code outside of
   * sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to be aware of this detail.

/**
 *
 * Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
 * results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
 * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
 * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
 * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
 * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See
 * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
 *
 * Implementation Notes for IE
 * ---------------------------
 * IE <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
 * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
 * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
 * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
 * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
 * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.

 * @description
 * Selects a subset of items from `array` and returns it as a new array.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The source array.
 * @param {string|Object|function()} expression The predicate to be used for selecting items from
 *   `array`.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `string`: The string is used for matching against the contents of the `array`. All strings or
 *     objects with string properties in `array` that match this string will be returned. This also
 *     applies to nested object properties.
 *     The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.
 *
 *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained
 *     by `array`. For example `{name:"M", phone:"1"}` predicate will return an array of items
 *     which have property `name` containing "M" and property `phone` containing "1". A special
 *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:"text"}`) to accept a match against any
 *     property of the object or its nested object properties. That's equivalent to the simple
 *     substring match with a `string` as described above. The predicate can be negated by prefixing
 *     the string with `!`.
 *     For example `{name: "!M"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`
 *     not containing "M".
 *
 *     Note that a named property will match properties on the same level only, while the special
 *     `$` property will match properties on the same level or deeper. E.g. an array item like
 *     `{name: {first: 'John', last: 'Doe'}}` will **not** be matched by `{name: 'John'}`, but
 *     **will** be matched by `{$: 'John'}`.
 *
 *   - `function(value, index, array)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters.
 *     The function is called for each element of the array, with the element, its index, and
 *     the entire array itself as arguments.
 *
 *     The final result is an array of those elements that the predicate returned true for.
 *
 * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in
 *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from
 *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `function(actual, expected)`:
 *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and
 *     should return true if both values should be considered equal.
 *
 *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(actual, expected)}`.
 *     This is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.
 *
 *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case
 *     insensitive way.
 *
 *     Primitive values are converted to strings. Objects are not compared against primitives,
 *     unless they have a custom `toString` method (e.g. `Date` objects).

 *   * `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale
 *     (e.g. Sep 3, 2010 12:05:08 PM)

 *   * `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05:08 PM)
 *   * `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05 PM)
 *
 *   `format` string can contain literal values. These need to be escaped by surrounding with single quotes (e.g.
 *   `"h 'in the morning'"`). In order to output a single quote, escape it - i.e., two single quotes in a sequence
 *   (e.g. `"h 'o''clock'"`).
 *
 * @param {(Date|number|string)} date Date to format either as Date object, milliseconds (string or
 *    number) or various ISO 8601 datetime string formats (e.g. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ and its
 *    shorter versions like yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmZ, yyyy-MM-dd or yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ). If no timezone is
 *    specified in the string input, the time is considered to be in the local timezone.
 * @param {string=} format Formatting rules (see Description). If not specified,
 *    `mediumDate` is used.
 * @param {string=} timezone Timezone to be used for formatting. It understands UTC/GMT and the
 *    continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for
 *    example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *    If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.
 * @returns {string} Formatted string or the input if input is not recognized as date/millis.

 * @description
 * Creates a new array or string containing only a specified number of elements. The elements

 * the value and sign (positive or negative) of `limit`. If a number is used as input, it is
 * converted to a string.
 *
 * @param {Array|string|number} input Source array, string or number to be limited.
 * @param {string|number} limit The length of the returned array or string. If the `limit` number
 *     is positive, `limit` number of items from the beginning of the source array/string are copied.
 *     If the number is negative, `limit` number  of items from the end of the source array/string
 *     are copied. The `limit` will be trimmed if it exceeds `array.length`. If `limit` is undefined,
 *     the input will be returned unchanged.
 * @param {(string|number)=} begin Index at which to begin limitation. As a negative index, `begin`
 *     indicates an offset from the end of `input`. Defaults to `0`.
 * @returns {Array|string} A new sub-array or substring of length `limit` or less if input array
 *     had less than `limit` elements.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name orderBy
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Orders a specified `array` by the `expression` predicate. It is ordered alphabetically
 * for strings and numerically for numbers. Note: if you notice numbers are not being sorted
 * as expected, make sure they are actually being saved as numbers and not strings.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The array to sort.
 * @param {function(*)|string|Array.<(function(*)|string)>=} expression A predicate to be
 *    used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.
 *
 *    Can be one of:
 *
 *    - `function`: Getter function. The result of this function will be sorted using the
 *      `<`, `===`, `>` operator.
 *    - `string`: An Angular expression. The result of this expression is used to compare elements
 *      (for example `name` to sort by a property called `name` or `name.substr(0, 3)` to sort by
 *      3 first characters of a property called `name`). The result of a constant expression
 *      is interpreted as a property name to be used in comparisons (for example `"special name"`
 *      to sort object by the value of their `special name` property). An expression can be
 *      optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control ascending or descending sort order
 *      (for example, `+name` or `-name`). If no property is provided, (e.g. `'+'`) then the array
 *      element itself is used to compare where sorting.
 *    - `Array`: An array of function or string predicates. The first predicate in the array
 *      is used for sorting, but when two items are equivalent, the next predicate is used.
 *
 *    If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} reverse Reverse the order of the array.
 * @returns {Array} Sorted copy of the source array.
 *
 *
 * @example
 * The example below demonstrates a simple ngRepeat, where the data is sorted
 * by age in descending order (predicate is set to `'-age'`).
 * `reverse` is not set, which means it defaults to `false`.

 * A special directive is necessary because we cannot use interpolation inside the `disabled`

 * <!-- See below for an example of ng-disabled being used correctly -->

 * If we put an Angular interpolation expression into such an attribute then the
 * binding information would be lost when the browser removes the attribute.
 *
 * @example

 */

 /**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name form
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * Directive that instantiates
 * {@link form.FormController FormController}.
 *
 * If the `name` attribute is specified, the form controller is published onto the current scope under
 * this name.
 *
 * # Alias: {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`}
 *
 * In Angular, forms can be nested. This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child
 * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so
 * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to
 * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when
 * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`
 * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an
 * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.
 *
 *
 * # CSS classes
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.
 *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 *
 * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action
 *
 * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical
 * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full
 * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered
 * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.
 *
 * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the
 * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.
 *
 * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when
 * a form is submitted:
 *
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first
  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])
 *
 * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}
 * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.
 * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:
 *
 * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit
 * (`ngSubmit`)
 * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter
 * doesn't trigger submit
 * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then
 * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or
 * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)
 *
 * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is
 * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.
 * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any
 * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how
 * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well
 * as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-form {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-form.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
    <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="formExample">
      <file name="index.html">
       <script>
         angular.module('formExample', [])
           .controller('FormController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
             $scope.userType = 'guest';
           }]);
       </script>
       <style>
        .my-form {
          transition:all linear 0.5s;
          background: transparent;
        }
        .my-form.ng-invalid {
          background: red;
        }
       </style>
       <form name="myForm" ng-controller="FormController" class="my-form">
         userType: <input name="input" ng-model="userType" required>
         <span class="error" ng-show="myForm.input.$error.required">Required!</span><br>

   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} required Adds `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel value does not match
   *    a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
   *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
   *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
   *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
   *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
   *    account.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
   *    interaction with the input element.
   * @param {boolean=} [ngTrim=true] If set to false Angular will not automatically trim the input.
   *    This parameter is ignored for input[type=password] controls, which will never trim the
   *    input.

   * the HTML5 month input, a text element will be used. In that case, the text must be entered in a valid ISO-8601
   * month format (yyyy-MM), for example: `2009-01`.
   *
   * The model must always be a Date object, otherwise Angular will throw an error.
   * Invalid `Date` objects (dates whose `getTime()` is `NaN`) will be rendered as an empty string.
   * If the model is not set to the first of the month, the next view to model update will set it
   * to the first of the month.
   *
   * The timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model can be defined using
   * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions}. By default, this is the timezone of the browser.
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.

   * a valid ISO month format (yyyy-MM).
   * @param {string=} max Sets the `max` validation error key if the value entered is greater than `max`. This must
   * be a valid ISO month format (yyyy-MM).
   * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to

   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.

   * @description
   * Text input with number validation and transformation. Sets the `number` validation

   * <div class="alert alert-warning">
   * The model must always be of type `number` otherwise Angular will throw an error.

   * ## Issues with HTML5 constraint validation
   *
   * In browsers that follow the
   * [HTML5 specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#number-state-%28type=number%29),
   * `input[number]` does not work as expected with {@link ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions.allowInvalid`}.
   * If a non-number is entered in the input, the browser will report the value as an empty string,
   * which means the view / model values in `ngModel` and subsequently the scope value
   * will also be an empty string.
   *
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} min Sets the `min` validation error key if the value entered is less than `min`.
   * @param {string=} max Sets the `max` validation error key if the value entered is greater than `max`.
   * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel value does not match
   *    a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
   *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
   *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
   *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
   *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
   *    account.

   * @param {string} value The value to which the `ngModel` expression should be set when selected.
   *    Note that `value` only supports `string` values, i.e. the scope model needs to be a string,
   *    too. Use `ngValue` if you need complex models (`number`, `object`, ...).
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
   *    interaction with the input element.
   * @param {string} ngValue Angular expression to which `ngModel` will be be set when the radio
   *    is selected. Should be used instead of the `value` attribute if you need
   *    a non-string `ngModel` (`boolean`, `array`, ...).

 * HTML input element control. When used together with {@link ngModel `ngModel`}, it provides data-binding,
 * input state control, and validation.
 * Input control follows HTML5 input types and polyfills the HTML5 validation behavior for older browsers.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Not every feature offered is available for all input types.
 * Specifically, data binding and event handling via `ng-model` is unsupported for `input[file]`.
 * </div>
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
 * @param {boolean=} ngRequired Sets `required` attribute if set to true
 * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
 *    minlength.
 * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
 *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of any
 *    length.
 * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel value does not match
 *    a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
 *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
 *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
 *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
 *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />

 *    interaction with the input element.
 * @param {boolean=} [ngTrim=true] If set to false Angular will not automatically trim the input.

 * The `ngBind` attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element

 * expression changes.
 *
 * Typically, you don't use `ngBind` directly, but instead you use the double curly markup like
 * `{{ expression }}` which is similar but less verbose.
 *
 * It is preferable to use `ngBind` instead of `{{ expression }}` if a template is momentarily
 * displayed by the browser in its raw state before Angular compiles it. Since `ngBind` is an
 * element attribute, it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading.
 *
 * An alternative solution to this problem would be using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak} directive.
 *
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngClass
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngClass` directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding
 * an expression that represents all classes to be added.
 *
 * The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression
 * evaluates to:
 *
 * 1. If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class
 * names.
 *
 * 2. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the
 * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.
 *
 * 3. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should either be a string as in
 * type 1 or an object as in type 2. This means that you can mix strings and objects together in an array
 * to give you more control over what CSS classes appear. See the code below for an example of this.
 *
 *
 * The directive won't add duplicate classes if a particular class was already set.
 *
 * When the expression changes, the previously added classes are removed and only then are the
 * new classes added.
 *
 * @animations
 * **add** - happens just before the class is applied to the elements
 *
 * **remove** - happens just before the class is removed from the element
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngClass {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval. The result
 *   of the evaluation can be a string representing space delimited class
 *   names, an array, or a map of class names to boolean values. In the case of a map, the
 *   names of the properties whose values are truthy will be added as css classes to the
 *   element.
 *
 * @example Example that demonstrates basic bindings via ngClass directive.

      <input id="setbtn" type="button" value="set" ng-click="myVar='my-class'">
      <input id="clearbtn" type="button" value="clear" ng-click="myVar=''">
      <br>
      <span class="base-class" ng-class="myVar">Sample Text</span>
     </file>
     <file name="style.css">
       .base-class {
         transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
       }

       .base-class.my-class {
         color: red;
         font-size:3em;
       }
     </file>
     <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
       it('should check ng-class', function() {
         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('setbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('clearbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);
       });
     </file>
   </example>


   ## ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations
   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.
   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder
   any pre-existing CSS transitions already on the element. To get an idea of what happens during a class-based animation, be sure
   to view the step by step details of {@link $animate#addClass $animate.addClass} and
   {@link $animate#removeClass $animate.removeClass}.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngCloak
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngCloak` directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly
 * displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this
 * directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.
 *
 * The directive can be applied to the `<body>` element, but the preferred usage is to apply
 * multiple `ngCloak` directives to small portions of the page to permit progressive rendering
 * of the browser view.
 *
 * `ngCloak` works in cooperation with the following css rule embedded within `angular.js` and
 * `angular.min.js`.
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```css
 * [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
 *   display: none !important;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When this css rule is loaded by the browser, all html elements (including their children) that
 * are tagged with the `ngCloak` directive are hidden. When Angular encounters this directive
 * during the compilation of the template it deletes the `ngCloak` element attribute, making
 * the compiled element visible.
 *
 * For the best result, the `angular.js` script must be loaded in the head section of the html
 * document; alternatively, the css rule above must be included in the external stylesheet of the
 * application.
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngController
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngController` directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular
 * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
 *
 * MVC components in angular:
 *
 * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties
 *   are accessed through bindings.
 * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
 * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business
 *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values
 *
 * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition
 * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller
 * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached
 * and executed twice.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 500
 * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}
 * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.
 *
 * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying
 * `ng-controller="as propertyName"`.
 *
 * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may
 * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (not recommended).
 *
 * @example
 * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and
 * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can
 * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected
 * in the View without the need for a manual update.
 *
 * Two different declaration styles are included below:
 *
 * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController1 as settings"`
 * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController2"`
 *
 * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates
 * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller
 * and avoiding scope.
 *
 * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when
 * multiple controllers apply to an element.
 * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and
 * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.
 * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal
 * inheritance masking primitives.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngCsp
 *
 * @element html
 * @description
 *
 * Angular has some features that can break certain
 * [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP) rules.
 *
 * If you intend to implement these rules then you must tell Angular not to use these features.
 *
 * This is necessary when developing things like Google Chrome Extensions or Universal Windows Apps.
 *
 *
 * The following rules affect Angular:
 *
 * * `unsafe-eval`: this rule forbids apps to use `eval` or `Function(string)` generated functions
 * (among other things). Angular makes use of this in the {@link $parse} service to provide a 30%
 * increase in the speed of evaluating Angular expressions.
 *
 * * `unsafe-inline`: this rule forbids apps from inject custom styles into the document. Angular
 * makes use of this to include some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ngCloak} and {@link ngHide}).
 * To make these directives work when a CSP rule is blocking inline styles, you must link to the
 * `angular-csp.css` in your HTML manually.
 *
 * If you do not provide `ngCsp` then Angular tries to autodetect if CSP is blocking unsafe-eval
 * and automatically deactivates this feature in the {@link $parse} service. This autodetection,
 * however, triggers a CSP error to be logged in the console:
 *
 * ```
 * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of
 * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that
 * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
 * ```
 *
 * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`
 * directive on an element of the HTML document that appears before the `<script>` tag that loads
 * the `angular.js` file.
 *
 * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*
 *
 * You can specify which of the CSP related Angular features should be deactivated by providing
 * a value for the `ng-csp` attribute. The options are as follows:
 *
 * * no-inline-style: this stops Angular from injecting CSS styles into the DOM
 *
 * * no-unsafe-eval: this stops Angular from optimising $parse with unsafe eval of strings
 *
 * You can use these values in the following combinations:
 *
 *
 * * No declaration means that Angular will assume that you can do inline styles, but it will do
 * a runtime check for unsafe-eval. E.g. `<body>`. This is backwardly compatible with previous versions
 * of Angular.
 *
 * * A simple `ng-csp` (or `data-ng-csp`) attribute will tell Angular to deactivate both inline
 * styles and unsafe eval. E.g. `<body ng-csp>`. This is backwardly compatible with previous versions
 * of Angular.
 *
 * * Specifying only `no-unsafe-eval` tells Angular that we must not use eval, but that we can inject
 * inline styles. E.g. `<body ng-csp="no-unsafe-eval">`.
 *
 * * Specifying only `no-inline-style` tells Angular that we must not inject styles, but that we can
 * run eval - no automcatic check for unsafe eval will occur. E.g. `<body ng-csp="no-inline-style">`
 *
 * * Specifying both `no-unsafe-eval` and `no-inline-style` tells Angular that we must not inject
 * styles nor use eval, which is the same as an empty: ng-csp.
 * E.g.`<body ng-csp="no-inline-style;no-unsafe-eval">`
 *
 * @example
 * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.
   ```html
     <!doctype html>
     <html ng-app ng-csp>
     ...
     ...
     </html>
   ```
  * @example
      // Note: the suffix `.csp` in the example name triggers
      // csp mode in our http server!
      <example name="example.csp" module="cspExample" ng-csp="true">

 * Enables binding angular expressions to onsubmit events.
 *
 * Additionally it prevents the default action (which for form means sending the request to the

 * `data-action`, or `x-action` attributes.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Warning:** Be careful not to cause "double-submission" by using both the `ngClick` and
 * `ngSubmit` handlers together. See the
 * {@link form#submitting-a-form-and-preventing-the-default-action `form` directive documentation}
 * for a detailed discussion of when `ngSubmit` may be triggered.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngIf
 * @restrict A
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an
 * {expression}. If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false
 * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from
 * its parent scope using
 * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`
 * and `leave` effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - happens just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container
 * leave - happens just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 600
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree. If it is truthy a copy of the compiled
 *     element is added to the DOM tree.
 *
 * @example
  <example module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true">
    <file name="index.html">

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngList
 *
 * @description
 * Text input that converts between a delimited string and an array of strings. The default
 * delimiter is a comma followed by a space - equivalent to `ng-list=", "`. You can specify a custom
 * delimiter as the value of the `ngList` attribute - for example, `ng-list=" | "`.
 *
 * The behaviour of the directive is affected by the use of the `ngTrim` attribute.
 * * If `ngTrim` is set to `"false"` then whitespace around both the separator and each
 *   list item is respected. This implies that the user of the directive is responsible for
 *   dealing with whitespace but also allows you to use whitespace as a delimiter, such as a
 *   tab or newline character.
 * * Otherwise whitespace around the delimiter is ignored when splitting (although it is respected
 *   when joining the list items back together) and whitespace around each list item is stripped
 *   before it is added to the model.

will be set to `undefined` unless {@link ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions.allowInvalid`}
is set to `true`. The parse error is stored in `ngModel.$error.parse`.

 *
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $formatters Array of functions to execute, as a pipeline, whenever
       the model value changes. The functions are called in reverse array order, each passing the value through to the

       Used to format / convert values for display in the control.

 *   }
 * }

 * ```
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $validators A collection of validators that are applied
 *      whenever the model value changes. The key value within the object refers to the name of the
 *      validator while the function refers to the validation operation. The validation operation is
 *      provided with the model value as an argument and must return a true or false value depending
 *      on the response of that validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$validators.validCharacters = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *   return /[0-9]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /[a-z]+/.test(value) &&

 *      is expected to return a promise when it is run during the model validation process. Once the promise
 *      is delivered then the validation status will be set to true when fulfilled and false when rejected.
 *      When the asynchronous validators are triggered, each of the validators will run in parallel and the model
 *      value will only be updated once all validators have been fulfilled. As long as an asynchronous validator
 *      is unfulfilled, its key will be added to the controllers `$pending` property. Also, all asynchronous validators
 *      will only run once all synchronous validators have passed.
 *
 * Please note that if $http is used then it is important that the server returns a success HTTP response code
 * in order to fulfill the validation and a status level of `4xx` in order to reject the validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$asyncValidators.uniqueUsername = function(modelValue, viewValue) {

 * @description
 *
 * `NgModelController` provides API for the {@link ngModel `ngModel`} directive.
 * The controller contains services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting
 * and parsing. It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or
 * listening to DOM events.
 * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of
 * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.
 * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.
 * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example
 * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.
 *
 * @example
 * ### Custom Control Example
 * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve
 * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)
 * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.
 *
 * `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element
 * contents be edited in place by the user.
 *
 * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}
 * module to automatically remove "bad" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick="...">`).
 * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks
 * that content using the `$sce` service.
 *
 * <example name="NgModelController" module="customControl" deps="angular-sanitize.js">
    <file name="style.css">
      [contenteditable] {
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: white;
        min-height: 20px;
      }

      .ng-invalid {
        border: 1px solid red;
      }

   * @description
   * Cancel an update and reset the input element's value to prevent an update to the `$modelValue`,
   * which may be caused by a pending debounced event or because the input is waiting for a some
   * future event.
   *
   * If you have an input that uses `ng-model-options` to set up debounced events or events such
   * as blur you can have a situation where there is a period when the `$viewValue`
   * is out of synch with the ngModel's `$modelValue`.
   *
   * In this case, you can run into difficulties if you try to update the ngModel's `$modelValue`
   * programmatically before these debounced/future events have resolved/occurred, because Angular's
   * dirty checking mechanism is not able to tell whether the model has actually changed or not.
   *
   * The `$rollbackViewValue()` method should be called before programmatically changing the model of an
   * input which may have such events pending. This is important in order to make sure that the
   * input field will be updated with the new model value and any pending operations are cancelled.

   * Update the view value.
   *
   * This method should be called when an input directive want to change the view value; typically,
   * this is done from within a DOM event handler.
   *
   * For example {@link ng.directive:input input} calls it when the value of the input changes and
   * {@link ng.directive:select select} calls it when an option is selected.
   *
   * If the new `value` is an object (rather than a string or a number), we should make a copy of the
   * object before passing it to `$setViewValue`.  This is because `ngModel` does not perform a deep
   * watch of objects, it only looks for a change of identity. If you only change the property of
   * the object then ngModel will not realise that the object has changed and will not invoke the
   * `$parsers` and `$validators` pipelines.
   *
   * For this reason, you should not change properties of the copy once it has been passed to
   * `$setViewValue`. Otherwise you may cause the model value on the scope to change incorrectly.
   *
   * When this method is called, the new `value` will be staged for committing through the `$parsers`
   * and `$validators` pipelines. If there are no special {@link ngModelOptions} specified then the staged
   * value sent directly for processing, finally to be applied to `$modelValue` and then the
   * **expression** specified in the `ng-model` attribute.
   *
   * Lastly, all the registered change listeners, in the `$viewChangeListeners` list, are called.
   *
   * In case the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions} directive is used with `updateOn`
   * and the `default` trigger is not listed, all those actions will remain pending until one of the
   * `updateOn` events is triggered on the DOM element.
   * All these actions will be debounced if the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions}
   * directive is used with a custom debounce for this particular event.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModel
 *
 * @element input
 * @priority 1
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
 * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
 * which is created and exposed by this directive.
 *
 * `ngModel` is responsible for:
 *
 * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
 *   require.
 * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
 * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, touched/untouched, validation errors).
 * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`, `ng-touched`, `ng-untouched`) including animations.
 * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
 *
 * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
 * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
 * implicitly and added to the scope.
 *
 * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)
 *
 * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
 *    - {@link input[text] text}
 *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
 *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
 *    - {@link input[number] number}
 *    - {@link input[email] email}
 *    - {@link input[url] url}
 *    - {@link input[date] date}
 *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}
 *    - {@link input[time] time}
 *    - {@link input[month] month}
 *    - {@link input[week] week}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
 *
 * # CSS classes
 * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
 * depending on the validity of the model.
 *
 *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid
 *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid
 *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
 *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with
 *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred
 *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred
 *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
 * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
 * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
 * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
 * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-input {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-input.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
 * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="inputExample">
     <file name="index.html">
       <script>
        angular.module('inputExample', [])
          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
            $scope.val = '1';
          }]);
       </script>
       <style>
         .my-input {
           transition:all linear 0.5s;
           background: transparent;
         }
         .my-input.ng-invalid {
           color:white;
           background: red;
         }
       </style>
       <p id="inputDescription">
        Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
        Integer is a valid value.
       </p>
       <form name="testForm" ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input"
                aria-describedby="inputDescription" />
       </form>
     </file>
 * </example>
 *
 * ## Binding to a getter/setter
 *
 * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a
 * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets
 * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this
 * for models that have an internal representation that's different from what the model exposes
 * to the view.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more
 * frequently than other parts of your code.
 * </div>
 *
 * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to an element that
 * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to
 * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See
 * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:
 *
 * @example
 * <example name="ngModel-getter-setter" module="getterSetterExample">
     <file name="index.html">

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModelOptions
 *
 * @description
 * Allows tuning how model updates are done. Using `ngModelOptions` you can specify a custom list of
 * events that will trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only
 * takes place when a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.
 *
 * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might
 * be different from the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you
 * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`} on the relevant input field in
 * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.
 *
 * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`}
 * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is
 * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their
 * `name` attribute.
 *
 * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the
 * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * `ngModelOptions` has an effect on the element it's declared on and its descendants.
 *
 * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to the current model. Valid keys are:
 *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several
 *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that
 *     matches the default events belonging of the control.
 *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A
 *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a
 *     custom value for each event. For example:
 *     `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { 'default': 500, 'blur': 0 } }"`
 *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did
 *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.
 *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to
       `ngModel` as getters/setters.
 *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for
 *     `<input type="date">`, `<input type="time">`, ... . It understands UTC/GMT and the
 *     continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for
 *     example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *     If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.
 *
 * @example

  The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the
  form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is
  pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.

  <example name="ngModelOptions-directive-blur" module="optionsExample">
    <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
        <form name="userForm">

                   ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'blur' }"
                   ng-keyup="cancel($event)" />
          </label><br />
          <label>Other data:
            <input type="text" ng-model="user.data" />
          </label><br />
        </form>
        <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind="user.name"></span></pre>

            if (e.keyCode == 27) {
              $scope.userForm.userName.$rollbackViewValue();
            }
          };
        }]);
    </file>
    <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
      var model = element(by.binding('user.name'));
      var input = element(by.model('user.name'));

      });

  </example>

  This one shows how to debounce model changes. Model will be updated only 1 sec after last change.
  If the `Clear` button is pressed, any debounced action is canceled and the value becomes empty.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngOptions
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngOptions` attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of `<option>`
 * elements for the `<select>` element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the
 * `ngOptions` comprehension expression.
 *
 * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of `ngOptions` to achieve a
 * similar result. However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing memory and
 * increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing
 * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the
 * comprehension expression. `ngOptions` should be used when the `<select>` model needs to be bound
 *  to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at
 * present.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property
 * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`
 * directive.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)
 *
 * **Note:** By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important when
 * binding any input directive to a model that is an object or a collection.
 *
 * Since this is a common situation for `ngOptions` the directive additionally watches the model using
 * `$watchCollection` when the select has the `multiple` attribute or when there is a `track by` clause in
 * the options expression. This allows ngOptions to trigger a re-rendering of the options even if the actual
 * object/collection has not changed identity but only a property on the object or an item in the collection
 * changes.
 *
 * Note that `$watchCollection` does a shallow comparison of the properties of the object (or the items in the collection
 * if the model is an array). This means that changing a property deeper inside the object/collection that the
 * first level will not trigger a re-rendering.
 *
 *
 * ## `select` **`as`**
 *
 * Using `select` **`as`** will bind the result of the `select` expression to the model, but
 * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)
 * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a **`track by`** expression
 * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.
 *
 *
 * ### `select` **`as`** and **`track by`**
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * Do not use `select` **`as`** and **`track by`** in the same expression. They are not designed to work together.
 * </div>
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <select ng-options="item.subItem as item.label for item in values track by item.id" ng-model="selected"></select>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * $scope.values = [{
 *   id: 1,
 *   label: 'aLabel',
 *   subItem: { name: 'aSubItem' }
 * }, {
 *   id: 2,
 *   label: 'bLabel',
 *   subItem: { name: 'bSubItem' }
 * }];
 *
 * $scope.selected = { name: 'aSubItem' };
 * ```
 *
 * With the purpose of preserving the selection, the **`track by`** expression is always applied to the element
 * of the data source (to `item` in this example). To calculate whether an element is selected, we do the
 * following:
 *
 * 1. Apply **`track by`** to the elements in the array. In the example: `[1, 2]`
 * 2. Apply **`track by`** to the already selected value in `ngModel`.
 *    In the example: this is not possible as **`track by`** refers to `item.id`, but the selected
 *    value from `ngModel` is `{name: 'aSubItem'}`, so the **`track by`** expression is applied to
 *    a wrong object, the selected element can't be found, `<select>` is always reset to the "not
 *    selected" option.
 *
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
 *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
 *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
 * @param {comprehension_expression=} ngOptions in one of the following forms:
 *
 *   * for array data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` | orderBy:`orderexpr` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *        (for including a filter with `track by`)
 *   * for object data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`

 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`

 *   * `value`: local variable which will refer to each item in the `array` or each property value

 *     `expression` will most likely refer to the `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).
 *   * `select`: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent `<select>`
 *      element. If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.
 *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`
 *      DOM element.
 *   * `disable`: The result of this expression will be used to disable the rendered `<option>`
 *      element. Return `true` to disable.
 *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be
 *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the
 *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`). With this the selection is preserved
 *      even when the options are recreated (e.g. reloaded from the server).

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngPluralize
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * `ngPluralize` is a directive that displays messages according to en-US localization rules.
 * These rules are bundled with angular.js, but can be overridden
 * (see {@link guide/i18n Angular i18n} dev guide). You configure ngPluralize directive
 * by specifying the mappings between
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * and the strings to be displayed.
 *
 * # Plural categories and explicit number rules
 * There are two
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * in Angular's default en-US locale: "one" and "other".
 *
 * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, "other" can match
 * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the
 * explicit number rule for "3" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories
 * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize
 * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.
 * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.
 *
 * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression
 * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.
 *
 * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual
 * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.
 *
 * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount"
                 when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 *```
 *
 * In the example, `"0: Nobody is viewing."` is an explicit number rule. If you did not
 * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the "other" category and "0 people are viewing"
 * would be shown instead of "Nobody is viewing". You can specify an explicit number rule for
 * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing "12 people are viewing", you can
 * show "a dozen people are viewing".
 *
 * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted
 * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with
 * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder
 * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.
 *
 * If no rule is defined for a category, then an empty string is displayed and a warning is generated.
 * Note that some locales define more categories than `one` and `other`. For example, fr-fr defines `few` and `many`.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset
 * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in
 * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message "4 people are viewing this document",
 * you might display "John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document".
 * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.
 * Let's take a look at an example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount" offset=2
 *               when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',
 *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',
 *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added
 * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.
 * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, "John is viewing" will be shown.
 * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so
 * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.
 * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and "John, Mary and one other person are viewing"
 * is shown.
 *
 * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for
 * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,
 * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for
 * plural categories "one" and "other".
 *
 * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.
 * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.
 * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngRepeat
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngRepeat` directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template
 * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,
 * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.
 *
 * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:
 *
 * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |
 * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |
 * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |
 * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |
 * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |
 * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |
 * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |
 *
 * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.
 * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.
 *
 *
 * # Iterating over object properties
 *
 * It is possible to get `ngRepeat` to iterate over the properties of an object using the following
 * syntax:
 *
 * ```js
 * <div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj"> ... </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You need to be aware that the JavaScript specification does not define the order of keys
 * returned for an object. (To mitigate this in Angular 1.3 the `ngRepeat` directive
 * used to sort the keys alphabetically.)
 *
 * Version 1.4 removed the alphabetic sorting. We now rely on the order returned by the browser
 * when running `for key in myObj`. It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
 * keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions when keys are deleted
 * and reinstated. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues
 *
 * If this is not desired, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array
 * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`.  You could
 * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)
 * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.
 *
 *
 * # Tracking and Duplicates
 *
 * When the contents of the collection change, `ngRepeat` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 *
 * By default, `ngRepeat` does not allow duplicate items in arrays. This is because when
 * there are duplicates, it is not possible to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection
 * items and DOM elements.
 *
 * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior
 * with your own using the `track by` expression.
 *
 * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the
 * special scope property `$index`:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You may use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions
 * on the scope:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * If you are working with objects that have an identifier property, you can track
 * by the identifier instead of the whole object. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`
 * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the
 * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="model in collection track by model.id">
 *      {{model.name}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in
 * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="obj in collection track by $id(obj)">
 *      {{obj.prop}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** `track by` must always be the last expression:
 * </div>
 * ```
 * <div ng-repeat="model in collection | orderBy: 'id' as filtered_result track by model.id">
 *     {{model.name}}
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * # Special repeat start and end points
 * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending
 * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.
 * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)
 * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.
 *
 * The example below makes use of this feature:
 * ```html
 *   <header ng-repeat-start="item in items">
 *     Header {{ item }}
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 *   <footer ng-repeat-end>
 *     Footer {{ item }}
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:
 * ```html
 *   <header>
 *     Header A
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body A
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer A
 *   </footer>
 *   <header>
 *     Header B
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body B
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer B
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such
 * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).
 *
 * @animations
 * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter
 *
 * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out
 *
 * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 1000
 * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These
 *   formats are currently supported:
 *
 *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`
 *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.
 *
 *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,
 *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression
 *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression
 *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have
 *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are
 *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)
 *
 *     Note that the tracking expression must come last, after any filters, and the alias expression.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements
 *     will be associated by item identity in the array.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique
 *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements
 *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM
 *     element in the same way in the DOM.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this
 *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`
 *     property is same.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter
 *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the
 *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message
 *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after
 *     the items have been processed through the filter.
 *
 *     Please note that `as [variable name] is not an operator but rather a part of ngRepeat micro-syntax so it can be used only at the end
 *     (and not as operator, inside an expression).
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter : x | orderBy : order | limitTo : limit as results` .
 *
 * @example
 * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and
 * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngShow
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngShow` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression
 * provided to the `ngShow` attribute. The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding
 * the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined
 * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue"></div>
 *
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue" class="ng-hide"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a falsy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class
 * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When truthy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed
 * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.
 *
 * ## Why is !important used?
 *
 * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector
 * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple
 * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.
 * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.
 *
 * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector
 * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the
 * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.
 *
 * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`
 *
 * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change
 * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`
 * class CSS. Note that the selector that needs to be used is actually `.ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate)` to cope
 * with extra animation classes that can be added.
 *
 * ```css
 * .ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate) {
 *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/
 *   display: block!important;
 *   position: absolute;
 *   top: -9999px;
 *   left: -9999px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.
 *
 * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`
 *
 * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression
 * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that
 * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property
 * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.
 *
 * ```css
 * //
 * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page
 * //
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {
 *   /&#42; this is required as of 1.3x to properly
 *      apply all styling in a show/hide animation &#42;/
 *   transition: 0s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add-active,
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove-active {
 *   /&#42; the transition is defined in the active class &#42;/
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display
 * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.
 *
 * @animations
 * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible
 * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy
 *     then the element is shown or hidden respectively.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngHide
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngHide` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression
 * provided to the `ngHide` attribute. The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding
 * the `ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined
 * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is hidden) -->
 * <div ng-hide="myValue" class="ng-hide"></div>
 *
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is visible) -->
 * <div ng-hide="myValue"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a truthy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class
 * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When falsy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed
 * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.
 *
 * ## Why is !important used?
 *
 * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector
 * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple
 * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.
 * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.
 *
 * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector
 * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the
 * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.
 *
 * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`
 *
 * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change
 * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`
 * class in CSS:
 *
 * ```css
 * .ng-hide {
 *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/
 *   display: block!important;
 *   position: absolute;
 *   top: -9999px;
 *   left: -9999px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.
 *
 * ## A note about animations with `ngHide`
 *
 * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression
 * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass, except that the `.ng-hide`
 * CSS class is added and removed for you instead of your own CSS class.
 *
 * ```css
 * //
 * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page
 * //
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {
 *   transition: 0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display
 * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.
 *
 * @animations
 * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden
 * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to visible
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngHide If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy then
 *     the element is shown or hidden respectively.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngSwitch
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.
 * Elements within `ngSwitch` but without `ngSwitchWhen` or `ngSwitchDefault` directives will be preserved at the location
 * as specified in the template.
 *
 * The directive itself works similar to ngInclude, however, instead of downloading template code (or loading it
 * from the template cache), `ngSwitch` simply chooses one of the nested elements and makes it visible based on which element
 * matches the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
 * (where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`on="..."` attribute**
 * (or the **`ng-switch="..."` attribute**), define any inner elements inside of the directive and place
 * a when attribute per element. The when attribute is used to inform ngSwitch which element to display when the on
 * expression is evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the default
 * attribute is displayed.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * Be aware that the attribute values to match against cannot be expressions. They are interpreted
 * as literal string values to match against.
 * For example, **`ng-switch-when="someVal"`** will match against the string `"someVal"` not against the
 * value of the expression `$scope.someVal`.
 * </div>

 * @animations
 * enter - happens after the ngSwitch contents change and the matched child element is placed inside the container
 * leave - happens just after the ngSwitch contents change and just before the former contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @usage
 *
 * ```
 * <ANY ng-switch="expression">
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue1">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue2">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-default>...</ANY>
 * </ANY>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 1200
 * @param {*} ngSwitch|on expression to match against <code>ng-switch-when</code>.
 * On child elements add:
 *
 * * `ngSwitchWhen`: the case statement to match against. If match then this
 *   case will be displayed. If the same match appears multiple times, all the
 *   elements will be displayed.
 * * `ngSwitchDefault`: the default case when no other case match. If there
 *   are multiple default cases, all of them will be displayed when no other
 *   case match.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name select
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * HTML `SELECT` element with angular data-binding.
 *
 * The `select` directive is used together with {@link ngModel `ngModel`} to provide data-binding
 * between the scope and the `<select>` control (including setting default values).
 * Ìt also handles dynamic `<option>` elements, which can be added using the {@link ngRepeat `ngRepeat}` or
 * {@link ngOptions `ngOptions`} directives.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the value of the selected option will be bound
 * to the model identified by the `ngModel` directive. With static or repeated options, this is
 * the content of the `value` attribute or the textContent of the `<option>`, if the value attribute is missing.
 * If you want dynamic value attributes, you can use interpolation inside the value attribute.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * Note that the value of a `select` directive used without `ngOptions` is always a string.
 * When the model needs to be bound to a non-string value, you must either explictly convert it
 * using a directive (see example below) or use `ngOptions` to specify the set of options.
 * This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at present.
 * </div>
 *
 * If the viewValue of `ngModel` does not match any of the options, then the control
 * will automatically add an "unknown" option, which it then removes when the mismatch is resolved.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of {@link ng.directive:ngOptions
 * ngOptions} to achieve a similar result. However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits, such as
 * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the
 * comprehension expression, and additionally in reducing memory and increasing speed by not creating
 * a new scope for each repeated instance.
 * </div>
 *
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds required attribute and required validation constraint to
 * the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use ngRequired instead of required
 * when you want to data-bind to the required attribute.
 * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when selected option(s) changes due to user
 *    interaction with the select element.
 * @param {string=} ngOptions sets the options that the select is populated with and defines what is
 * set on the model on selection. See {@link ngOptions `ngOptions`}.
 *
 * @example
 * ### Simple `select` elements with static options
 *
 * <example name="static-select" module="staticSelect">
 * <file name="index.html">
 * <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
 *   <form name="myForm">

 *     </select><br>
 *
 *     <label for="singleSelect"> Single select with "not selected" option and dynamic option values: </label><br>
 *     <select name="singleSelect" ng-model="data.singleSelect">
 *       <option value="">---Please select---</option> <!-- not selected / blank option -->
 *       <option value="{{data.option1}}">Option 1</option> <!-- interpolation -->

 *       ],
 *      };
 *   }]);
 * </file>
 *</example>
 *
 *
 * ### Using `select` with `ngOptions` and setting a default value
 * See the {@link ngOptions ngOptions documentation} for more `ngOptions` usage examples.
 *
 * <example name="select-with-default-values" module="defaultValueSelect">
 * <file name="index.html">

 *       ],
 *       selectedOption: {id: '3', name: 'Option C'} //This sets the default value of the select in the ui
 *       };
 *   }]);
 * </file>
 *</example>
 *
 *
 * ### Binding `select` to a non-string value via `ngModel` parsing / formatting
 *
 * <example name="select-with-non-string-options" module="nonStringSelect">
 *   <file name="index.html">
 *     <select ng-model="model.id" convert-to-number>
